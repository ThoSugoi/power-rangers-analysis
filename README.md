## 2. Reason for Choosing the Dataset

The Power Rangers franchise has a rich history spanning over 25 seasons and more than 830 episodes. Analyzing this dataset can uncover trends in audience reception and the evolution of the show over time. By leveraging data visualization techniques, we can present engaging insights into what made certain seasons or episodes more popular than others. Additionally, the dataset is well-structured, making it ideal for answering interesting questions about viewer preferences, episode ratings, and season longevity.

## 3. Questions to Answer

### **Question 1: What were the most popular seasons based on IMDb ratings?**
